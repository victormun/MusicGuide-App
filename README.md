# MusicGuide-App
Android app that implements a list of music songs with the possibility to buy them via Google Play.

This app was developed as a project within the Udacity Android Development Course.

The purpose of this app is to show how to transition from one activity to another, without losing
focus over the first one. It also includes some intents to buy songs from an external source, 
such as Google Play.
